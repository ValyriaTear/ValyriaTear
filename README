Valyria Tear is an open-source single-player medieval-fantasy 2D J-RPG based on an extended Hero of Allacrost engine (See http://www.allacrost.org/) and inspired by classic console RPGs.
The player incarnates Bronann, a young boy forced to take part into the struggle for the possession of a mysterious crystal.
This powerful artifact will lead him to discover the actual threat set upon his world, but also courage and love.

The game has all the features you can expect from JRPG classics: entertaining story development, colourful map exploration, active side-view battles, character management, puzzles... It is also translated in several languages.

Linux compilation procedure:
Once you've unpacked the tarball or checked it out of Git, just run 'cmake . && make ' from the top-level directory at the prompt.

You'll then be able to play by typing: 'src/valyriatear'

Windows:
A Code::Blocks project file is also provided when compiling under Windows.
In that case, you might need the dependencies and headers files that can be downloaded at:
https://dl.dropbox.com/s/et9x2e73r6etbta/valyriatear-win32-depends-2012.08.30.zip?dl=1

To build on Windows with Visual Studio 2012, do this:
1.) git clone https://github.com/authenticate/ValyriaTear-VS2012-Dependencies.git
2.) Copy the ValyriaTear-VS2012-Dependencies folder into your Valyria Tear repository.
3.) Open the VS 2012 solution file: .../ValyriaTearRepository/vs2012/ValyriaTear.sln
4.) Build (F7)
5.) Run (F5)

Game directories included and used are:
dat/ img/ mus/ snd/ src/ po/

Library dependencies (you will need the following in order to compile and run the game):
Boost headers (Tested from 1.42 to 1.50) (make sure that the boost headers used to compile Luabind are the same version used to compile Valyria Tear)
GNU Gettext - (libiconv, libintl)
lua (5.1.x - 5.2.x) - (liblua)
Luabind 0.9.1 (Provided as a static library)
libz
libpng (1.2 to 1.6)
Ogg/Vorbis - (libogg, libvorbis, libvorbisenc, libvorbisfile)
OpenAL
OpenGL and GLU
SDL (1.2)
SDL_ttf (1.2)
SDL_image (1.2)
and:
Qt 4.8.x (only if you wish to compile the map editor)

Compiling with editor or debug feature support:

Using Cmake:
Use the -D parameter when invoking cmake to add compilation flags.

Add Editor compilation (Requires QT 4.8.x headers)
cmake -DEDITOR_SUPPORT=on .

Add debug menus, and debug commands:
cmake -DDEBUG_FEATURES=on .

Add both:
cmake -DDEBUG_FEATURES=on -DEDITOR_SUPPORT=on .

On Code::Blocks:
Got to Project->Build options, and add the flags in the #defines tab, i.e.:
DEBUG_MENU

Note that the editor can't be built using C::B. Use Qt-Creator and the MapEditor.pro file for that.
Be sure also to read the instructions within that file, as RTTI support must be enabled, and unicode disabled in the compile flags.
